 * \class CentroidPoint
 * \brief Represents a point with a centroid and associated weights.

 * This class is a specialization of `Point` and `HasWgtCent`. It combines the 
 * functionality of a basic point (from the `Point` class) with the added ability 
 * to store and manipulate weights and centroids (from the `HasWgtCent` class). 
 * It includes operations for normalization, adding weighted centroids, and 
 * comparison with other points.
 * 
 * \tparam PT The data type for the point's coordinates and weights (e.g., float, double).
 * \tparam PD The number of dimensions for the point (size of coordinates array).
