 * \class HasWgtCent

 *

 * and a counter (`count`). The size of the array and the data type for weights 
 * are determined by the template parameters `PT` (the type of weights) and `PD` 
 * (the number of elements in the array). The class also includes a method for 
 * resetting the weights and counter to their initial values.
 * 
 * \tparam PT The data type of the weights (e.g., float, double).
 * \tparam PD The size of the weight array (i.e., number of dimensions or elements).
